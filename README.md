* Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square.

### To Do
Additional Game Functionality
* Player selection: allow the user to select the image for the player character before starting the game. Use the different character images provided in the images folder.

* Collectibles: you can add gems to the game, allowing the player to collect them to make the game more interesting.
